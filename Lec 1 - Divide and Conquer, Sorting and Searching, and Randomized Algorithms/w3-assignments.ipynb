    "You should not count comparisons one-by-one. Rather, when there is a recursive call on a subarray of length $m$, you should simply add $m-1$ to your running total of comparisons. (This is because the pivot element is compared to each of the other $m-1$ elements in the subarray in this recursive call.)\n",
